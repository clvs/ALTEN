Hello,

Just want to point out that I am aware the project is missing a paging mecanism, but it does accomplish it's purpose of being able to search for images.
Also error handling may not be perfectly handled in some spots.
For fetching the images i have made a quick wrapper, usually i do use Alamofire.
The data manager of the app consists out of two wrappers, a web service wrapper and a coredata wrapper, while both are wrapped inside a single "data wrapper"
In terms of ui, i have used size classes just as a demo purpose, by settings different font sizes on labels.

Enjoy exploring the project! 
Laurentiu
